utemplate is a lightweight and memory-efficient template engine for
Python, primarily intended for usage with MicroPython
(https://github.com/micropython/micropython).

utemplate syntax is roughly based on Django/Jinja2 syntax (e.g.
"{% if %}"), but only the most needed features are offered (for
example, "filters" are syntactic sugar for function calls, and
so far not planned for implementation).

utemplates compiles templates to Python source code, specifically to
a generator function which, being iterated over, produces consecutive
parts (substrings) of a rendered template. This allows for minimal
memory usage during template substitution (with MicroPython, it starts
from mere hundreds of bytes). Generated Python code can be imported as
a module directly, or simple loader class is provided for convenience.
There is also loader class which will compile templates on the fly,
if not already compiled (currently not automatically recompiled if
changed, this is on TODO).

See examples/ directory for examples and supported features.

To test/manage templates, "utemplate_util.py" tool is provided. For
example, to quickly try a template (assuming you are already in
"examples/" dir):

micropython ../utemplate_util.py run squares.tpl

or

python3 ../utemplate_util.py run squares.tpl
